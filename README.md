Paint &amp; Drawing

A painting tool is a tool or function in a graphics editing or painting program used to change the area of the canvas or image by adding paint strokes or filling the areas with color.

Drawing is used to express one's creativity, and therefore has been prominent in the world of art. Throughout much of history, drawing was regarded as the foundation for artistic practice. Initially, artists used and reused wooden tablets for the production of their drawings.
